Based on the available information, I would recommend a buy rating for Netflix (NFLX) at its current price. The company has reported strong Q3 2021 earnings, with revenue and EPS meeting or beating estimates. Additionally, Netflix has reported a total of 222 million customers, with 67 million in the U.S., and expects to add 8.5 million subscribers in the December quarter. These figures indicate a strong demand for the company's services and a positive outlook for the future. Furthermore, the company's financial health, market sentiment, and qualitative data from EDGAR filings are also strong.

In terms of investment strategy, I would recommend a long-term approach, holding the stock for at least 12-24 months. Additionally, it would be beneficial to keep an eye on insider trading activity and upcoming events like earnings. With this information in mind, I am confident that this investment will provide a strong return for our client.
